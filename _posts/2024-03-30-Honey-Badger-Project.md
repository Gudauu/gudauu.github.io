What kind of person will have no one to talk to?  
I guess only the real losers.


I'm 22. International student living in a basement. 

Occasionally get sentimental. Quiet and harmless 99% of my whole life.

I realized I was a loser last night at 2am. Got sick two days ago and had tried to sleep early as a gesture of self-care. This attempt failed miserably after an hour. Lying in the dark, I did the only thing anyone in this situation would do. Ponder about life. 

That's when I had this desire to talk to someone. Some living creature, as long as they understand my language and can provide some sort of feedback. Take in my communication capability, I guess that criteria only apply to human beings. I reached for my phone and start going through my social media apps. After 15 minutes I gradually came to the realization that there's really no fit place for me to dump my shit to (and ngl my shit in mind was truly boring and meaningless it doesn't bring value to anyone).

Dumping shit used to be easy. I still vividly remember my first day on social media. It was on an app called QQ developed by Tencent. Back then my entire social circle was on that thing, and that basically equates to my classmates. The amount of stupid posts I made back then was beyond my present-day imagination. By the time I entered university, QQ was basically dead, feeding on its body was the almighty WeChat. The thing I hate about WeChat is that, well, it's fucking almighty. To the point that it single-handedly handled all my social contacts, including real estate agencies, customer service accounts, and those contractors that I only dealt with once. All these ppl that I don't share any real emotions with. Not to mention those not-so-pleasant memories associated with it. After coming to Canada I started maintaining my Instagram, which, according to my observation, is where ppl try hard to pretend they're rich and happy. Plus it's not exactly a text-friendly platform.

The good news is you don't necessarily need a listener to dump your shit. I guess that's primarily the reason why people keep gold fish and cactus. For me, I began writing journals, brick-and-mortar ones, back in 6th grade. Before I left for Canada, I had documented my life through 6-7 of them. The secrets revealed in there were once so fatal I used to dig holes inside chunky encyclopedias to hide them from my parents and potential alien intruders. Yet one interesting fact was that roughly 5 years after I finish each journal, I stopped worrying about their publicity anymore. To this date I'm pretty sure my mom, aunt and maybe my dad all laid fingers on my journals. Especially my mom, who made the effort to dig out the one in the encyclopedia and aligned them together on the bookshelf while cleaning my room. The content in there simply ceased "mattering" to me. Judging from this fact, life is actually not that serious. Everything will be forgiven and forgotten, sooner than you'd think.

The journal method worked great until university, around the same time when I painfully figured out Hogwarts was fake and so was my teenage dream. A better phrase would be I purely grew out of it. Gone were the days when I'd repost a koi fish before finals praying for good luck, when I'd upload selfies without the intrusive worries that my pics were censored. Time is dashing and technology is soaring, it's no time for being a kid in my social media bubble anymore. It's time to be a kid on my own website.

Oh forgot to mention my other rationality for going public is because, well, I want to see if there's more of my kind out there. 

Let's call it the honey badger project then.
