TL;DR: I'm explaining why you shouldn't pick up dead fish in the ocean.


### A Piece Of Textbook Article
Back in my elementary school, they taught kids Chinese using pieces of articles in text books. Since all the kids already spoke perfect Chinese out-of-the-box, the course "Chinese" was more like "literature", where kids were taught how to appreciate the beauty of human literature and mimic their style in writing. 

The pre-class homework we were required to do include:
* Underline the well-written sentences in the article using full lines and explain why it's good. 
* Underline the parts where you have trouble comprehending using wavy lines and mark your question aside. 
* Give a summary of the article, both content-wise and implication-wise, with no less than XXX words. 
* Parent signature needed as a sign of supervision. Absence of such comes with a punishment.

That was a damn headache. My elementary school experience was lowkey a nightmare, but that's not the main point of this post here. Maybe I'll touch more on that in later series.

Anyway, out of all those textbook articles I read, there's one that particularly stands out in my memory. Its title translated to "This fish care!"

> One morning after a storm, a man was walking on the beach and noticed that in the shallow puddles on the beach, there were many small fish that had been swept ashore by last night's storm.   
> 
> Although there may be hundreds or even thousands of trapped small fish near the seaside, it won't take long before the water in the shallow puddles will be sucked dry by the sand and evaporated by the sun, and the small fish will dry up and die.   
> 
> The man suddenly noticed a little boy on the beach who kept picking up small fish from shallow puddles and throwing them back into the sea.
> 
> The man couldn't help but walked over and said, "Son, there are hundreds of thousands of small fish in this puddle. You can't save them."  
> 
> "I know." The little boy replied without looking back.  
> 
> "Oh? Then why are you still throwing it? Who cares?"  
> 
> "This little fish cares!" the little boy answered as he picked up a small fish and threw it into the sea. "This one cares, this one cares too! And this one, this one, this one..."

This article intrigued me the first time I read it. Thing is, most articles selected for my elementary school textbook were easy to grasp and straightforward. They serve the purpose of teaching kids one principle or two, e.g. lying is bad, success never comes without perseverance, etc. But this story right here is a bit more than that. It's kinda hard to entitle it to one "principle".

For instance, from a humanitarian POV, it calls for people to exert kindness despite not being able to help it all. From a environmentalist's POV, they might argue it's wrong for human beings to interfere with natural selection. Narcissist might state this demonstrate the absolute power of human beings over animals. Popes will praise how much good and holiness can be achieved with as little as picking up a fish.
Anyway, it's hard to see a straightforward interpretation to this. It's open ended.

Young and naive as I was in my third grade, I already knew there's more to this world, to those notes we wrote down on the margins of the textbook, and there's no way for the teacher to explain them all. Nevertheless I still followed teacher's instruction neatly, picking out the easiest interpretation and wrote "This article calls for the kindness of people" in my homework. And as I expected, that's what'd being mentioned by the teacher in class, aka the standard answer.

Maybe inspired by that instance, later in the same school year, I wrote a homework article titled "My trip to the beach" which depicted my family trip to a beach park during holidays.

### "My Trip To The Beach"

> The sun was shining in the sky and the air was hot. My parents took me to the beach.  
> 
> There were a lot of people on the beach. Excited, I rushed into the water, playing against the tides.
While having fun, I noticed something shiny on the surface. I approached that thing, it appeared to be a dead fish, floating along the tides. It was huge, almost the size of my forearm. I grabbed it and tried to take a closer look.  
> 
> Barely had I bent my head down did I hear someone shouting "Wow look at that kid! She caught a large fish!" I looked around, fish in my hand, and saw a young man pointing at me. Several other people heard his words and peeked in my direction too. Feeling shy as so many eyes were staring at me, I let go of the fish and attempted to sneak away.  
> 
> Seconds after, that man noticed that fish was dead, as it floats mindlessly.   
> He sneared "What a naughty kid, trying to draw attention by pretending fish catching." Then he stepped away. 
> 
> Confused, I stood in the water and thought to myself, why would he think like that? I didn't try to pretend anything.  
> 
> I went back to my parents and built a big sandcastle. It was such a nice trip.

Next time I received this notebook, there's a large red "?" marked by my teacher at this composition, along with a 4 out of 10 score.

Later in class, the teacher specifically mentioned my work. She commented in front of my whole class "...the composition is well written, with vivid description of her experience. However, that's a rather weird incident. It's hard to suggest any meaningful implications. Do we blame that man for misunderstanding her? Can't really. Do we summarize this into a lesson learnt? No either. It's just so weird. I don't know what to make of this. That's why I gave her a 4 mark. When you write, pick a clear and indicative topic..."

That incident, the 4/10 one, marked the end of my meaningless, too-honest, truth-respecting writing style as early as my third grade. From then on each time I wrote, I made sure to think of some "meanings" first, then alter the storytelling to serve my purpose. Things with my Chinese teacher never went wrong again. But frankly, I don't like that at all. As I grew older I realize it's not wrong to write meaningless articles: it's just wrong for humble people to do that. If someone's influential, even a question mark they make will be documented and respected, because the meaning of that question mark comes from the fame of its author itself. But eventually, people want something out of your work. Without any meaningful stuff inside, they're nothing but dead fish in the ocean.


### Dimension Deficiency
I conceive this matter this way: people making meanings out of articles, graphs or whatever media is a process of trying to understand what's happening. They are mapping the original information from the author to their own brain dimensions. Usually during communication, some information is lost due to mismatched brain dimensions. That's why for maximal efficiency, the author tries to use common sense, like in the previous cases the elementary school principles, to mark up the message, as common sense is almost common to all brains.

But human thoughts are far too complex to be expressed in language, let alone common sense expressions. That's too much information lost. In my teenage years, there were crushes whom I both liked and hated, and my feeling towards them were more nuanced than that, I couldn't put my finger on any existing words. 

Same thing happens when I attempt to express a past experience to someone. I believe it's the same for everyone: when you recall a past memory, you don't just "see" it running in your head, there's a whole set up associated with that specific moment, that only you know, you feel. The subtlety of this is similar to how you associate a piece of music, a certain smell, with a memory. Just how the hell do I describe that moment to someone else? I wish they could experience through my brain instead, because putting them down into words only ruin the sacred feeling. 

Now, that's why (my excuse for) some people might behave weirdly, as per your perception, like uttering non-sense and dumping meaningless words on the internet. Cuz they simply don't care whether their message can be conveyed to common dimensions. At the end of the day, human can never truly understand another human anyway.

For me, the least I can do is keeping writing articles like kids picking up dead fish in the ocean, as a post remedy for my smothered creativity during school years. 

Despite the communication challenge, I'm a firm worshiper in the beauty of this high dimension structure of our universe. Not a single day pass by without me marvelling at the delicate subtlety enabled by consciousness. Life is not worth living without exploring the beauty of fellow human minds. Even though I might never get the full picture, I won't stop trying.
